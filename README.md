"Simulate passenger processing with queuing theory and Poisson distribution to enhance airport efficiency. Join our open-source project!"
Interface Simulation for Passenger Processing Time Analysis:

As part of our project, we've developed an "Interface Simulation" that allows us to calculate passenger processing times using queuing theory and the Poisson distribution. This simulation generates random processing times for passengers within an airport environment, simulating real-world scenarios.

The Purpose:
Our goal is to compare the actual passenger processing times with the ideal processing times, helping us analyze the efficiency of passenger handling within an airport.

How It Works:
The interface simulation leverages queuing theory and Poisson distribution to generate random processing times for passengers. By doing so, we can simulate passenger flows and processing times in a stochastic and realistic manner.

Running the Application:
To utilize this simulation, you'll need to execute the code that we've previously formulated. This code is designed to perform the simulations and provide you with insights into passenger processing times at the airport.

I used Python (version 3.X), HTML5, and CSS3 to create the interface. The project utilizes Flask to make the interface accessible via a web URL. To run the interface, execute the "app.py" file.

Join us in this effort to enhance airport operations and ensure that passenger processing is as efficient as possible. Your contributions and insights are greatly valued in our open-source project.
I used PythonAnywhere for web hosting since it is compatible to python.
